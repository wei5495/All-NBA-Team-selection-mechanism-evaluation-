# Sports-analytics Project (ALL NBA TEAM SELECTION MECHANISM EVALUATION)
An Evaluation of current all NBA team selection mechanism using optimization technique

Data Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA2021advanced.html

Motivation:<br>
All NBA Team selection is the highest honor that one player can achieve, only top 15 players in this league would be crowned with this title. Most of the time, the title is strongly related to player’s income, as many organizations reward their players with a great amount of money if selected as one of the All NBA Team players, using it as an incentive to motivate their players to thrive for greatness. Therefore, how fair the selection mechanism is becomes a worth-discussing problem. Current selection is solely based on the media and sports writers voting, and that leads to an issue - Subjectivity, which I’d like to know the magnitude of it. Furthermore, a machine learning model would be built to predict whether a player would be selected as an All NBA Team player by inputting one’s statistics.<br>

Packages needed: Gurobi, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn <br>
Methodology: <br>
1.Preprocess the data using pandas, including cleaning and manipulation.<br> 
2.Use Optimization model to understand whether the subjectivity exists in the ALL NBA TEAM selection or not.<br>
3.Comparing the optimized result with actuall data. <br>
4.Use Machine Learning model to predict future incident (Classification) <br>
